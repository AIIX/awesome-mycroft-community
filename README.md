awesome-mycroft-community
==========================

**awesome-mycroft-community** is an awesomelist for big, community projects built around Mycroft! It includes companionware, derivatives, and integrations with other systems.

This list is exclusively for third-party projects, for two reasons. First, there is no "authoritative" list of community projects, and the community has grown so large that one is needed.

Second, if something's here, it's explicitly *unsupported* by MycroftAI. Everything listed is developed or maintained by a community member, so you should *not* ask the company for tech support, but you *should* approach the developers on GitHub, the Mycroft forums, or in MycroftAI's official chat. Most of the developers whose projects make this list are (or have been) very active on forums and/or chat.

The primary criterion for inclusion is simple: Projects listed here are large undertakings, with committed developers who can engage with users. This **does not mean** that projects must be in a usable state, especially if those projects are meant to attract contributors! Everything is in early development at some point.

(Contributors: Please submit all your maintained projects. Please don't submit abandonware. We all have a lot of awesome repos we haven't touched since 2019. Let's not list those.)
